            Thank-you for checking out my portfolio site! My name is Adam
            Herdman, I am a recent graduate of University College Dublin's
            Master's Computer Science conversion course, having achieved a 2:1
            honours classification. Prior to this, I had also completed a
            Bachelor's degree in Creative Media Technologies, from the Institute
            of Art, Design and Technology in DÃºn Laoghaire, having achieved a
            1st class honours classification there.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have always had an interest in computers from a very young age,
            always wanting to play on the family computer, navigate that
            mysterious place called the Internet (though our computer was so
            outdated that many pages couldn't connect securely!) and I believe
            that this early introduction to computers shaped me a lot, leading
            to me to want to find out more about them.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, that would not come until way later in life -
            computers were never really a focus of my schooling until I had
            finished secondary school in 2017! When deciding on what to do next,
            I chose Creative Media Technology, as a newfound interest had been
            occupying my mind at that point - art.
            <br />
            <br />
            While I would not call myself an "artist", so to say, I would always
            like to dabble in media creation, drawing and tinkering with
            electronics. All of which came into play during my undergraduate
            course! This course allowed me to get acclimated with just how
            complex and difficult it actually is to get a project up off the
            ground and to anywhere near a completed state. This taught me to be
            proud of what work I do get finished, as it really is a big
            milestone to complete a project!
            <br />
            <br />
            During this course I also started to become more and more interested
            in just how people interact with programs and machines - how the UI
            of said works mattered, to be able to present a user with what they
            needed - not too much as to overwhelm them but not too little so
            that they had to trawl through menu upon menu to find what it is
            they're looking for. It's very hard balancing game though,
            everyone's tastes differ so wildly!
            <br />
            <br />
            Eventually, I graduated in 2021, right in the midst of the COVID-19
            pandemic, so I was a little strapped for finding such hands-on
            practical work for a bit. I had worked retail jobs for the
            intermediate years until I decided that I wanted to have a go at it
            again, to maybe pivot my course of direction back into what possibly
            started all of this - computers! I looked around and found UCD's
            Computer Science Masters course specifically designed for people who
            had little to no background in computer science. Seemed to fit the
            bill so I applied for it and got accepted! I began this course in
            2023.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through many ups and downs, hardship after hardship, I managed to
            complete the course! It was such a feature-filled course brimming
            with work to do, having only spanned about 16 months, so I got a
            great crash course into just what computer science would be like. I
            won't lie, it was incredibly difficult to initially get myself into
            the correct pattern of thinking to work well in the course, but
            after my first trimester, I think I had settled in nicely and was
            achieving grades I was proud of!
            <br />
            <br />
            In this course, I always naturally leaned towards frontend materials
            - being the primary designer and focusing heavily on UI elements in
            our Java project, doing design work and element cleanup on our
            Summer project - it just seemed to be what interested me the most. I
            love seeing the culmination of my work and always get a sense of
            pride when I have something working that can be seen and interacted
            with!
            <br />
            <br />
            On a more personal note, I have a big passion for creative outlets
            in general, with a love of art, video games, software as well as the
            more down-to-earth things like hanging out with my friends and
            family, playing with the dog and going out around the countryside. I
            love working alongside other people, always wanting to find a best
            solution to satisfy everyone involved. In my prior work, I was a
            supervisor for an electronics retail outlet called CeX, so I had a
            lot of responsibility making sure that the team got along well and
            that we could iron out any problems and get work done! I think I did
            this to a great degree, ensuring a happy workplace which in turn
            made for happy workers.

            Again, thank-you for checking out my portfolio, and another
            thank-you for reading this far if you did! Please be sure to check
            in periodically, as now that I have this site running, I intend to
            add to it with each project I finish that I feel is worth showing
            off! I do have more, but I wanted to show off some of the ones I'm
            most proud of first!
